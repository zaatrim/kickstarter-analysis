# **"Fever" Play Crowdfunding Campaign Project**

## Project Overview:
    ##    Louis is Planning a Crowdfunding Campaign for her upcoming Play “Fever”, her estimated Budget is well Over $10,000 and she is hesitant to start her fund-raising campaign. Louis is asking for help to determine which Factors can make her crowd funding Campaign successful, and which Campaigns in the same category she need to Mirror in order to set up her project for success.  In the this specific Analysis we will help Louis to determine how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 

## The analysis Objective: 
    ## To help Louis know how different campaigns fared to their launch dates and funding goals.


## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date : 
    ## The hypotheses, there is a relationship between Campgin outcome & Launch Date. we will visualize campaign outcomes ("successful," "failed," and "canceled") based on the launch date to examine the correlation and draw a conclusion

## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
    ## In Outcomes Based on Goals we will visualize the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled plays based on the funding goals amount.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered:
    ### The given intervals resulted in skipping 4 data points, where Goal equal to 50000 . Searched through each interval to locate the gaps. And Then Changed the Criteria for the last interval to be "Greater than 49999" instead of "Greater than 50000". 

## **Results**

- Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date shows:
    - Campaigns that launched during May had the highest success.. 
    - The window of opportunity for launching the campaign is April through August. 52% of successful campaigns were during this period. 

- Analysis of Outcomes based on Goals shows:
    - The highest success chances when Goals are less than $5000. (Have 76% to 73% success chance).
    - As goal increase, the chance of failure increase (Exception the intervals 35000 to 45000)

- Limitations of the dataset:
    - Outcome-Based on Goal Data is not in the Normal Distribution.

- Addtional recommendation: 
    - I would recommend adding analysis over time. In 2017 there is a significant change in outcomes and Pledge vs. 2016 & 2015.
